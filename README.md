## Features

*  The U-SPS enables deployment and execution of arbitrary scientific data processing algorithms through the standard OGC WPS-T API ("Open Geospatial Consortium Web Processing Service - Transactional Abstract Programming Interface")
   * Deploying and undeploying a science algorithm via the "/processes" endpoint
   * Executing and monitoring a job execution via the "/jobs" endpoint
   * Retrieving a job output via the "/results" endpoint
*  The U-SPS includes an API to manage the computing resources of the cluster (such as scaling up and down the number of computing nodes)
*  Internally, the U-SPS is composed of a system of interacting applications packaged as Docker containers and deployed into a Kubernetes cluster via a set of Terraform scripts.
*  The U-SPS supports multiple possible implementations. The two currently available are based on HySDS (Hybrid Science Data System) and Apache Airflow
